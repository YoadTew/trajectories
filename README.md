# Vehicle Trajctory Anomaly Detection
In this repository there is some of our work for a vision-based algorithm for **vehicle trajectory anomaly detection.**
<br>This includes going off the road, stopping in the middle of the road, crossing a red light etc.
<br>In this partial version, we rely on **Object detection** tools (such as detectron2) and **trackers** (such as Kalman fitler),
in addition to a **custom algorithm** for recognizing trajectory anomalies.
